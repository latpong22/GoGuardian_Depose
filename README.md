# GoGuardian_Depose

# Why is it called GoGuardian Depose?
This is because i used the name of the software and the verb "depose" since it means "To remove from a throne or other high position".
This is representive of what GoGuardian Depose does since it strips the spyware of it control and ability to censor your access to sites.

# What is the Basic Enforcment Policy?

This is a nickname for the fact that GoGuardian keeps a HARD block list which is blocks that can't be removed when the policy is redownloaded. 
Like for example GoGuardian still blocks going to IP addreses even after you redownload the policy. 
Since most policy's change your wifi to a orginzation apporved one if in range after siging in just connecting to it before won't work.
